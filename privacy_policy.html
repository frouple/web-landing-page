In order to use the Frouple app, it is necessary for the user to create a user profile.

                The data provided will be stored, processed and used by us for the purpose of using the Frouple app. This serves in particular the function of selecting recommendations for other user profiles according to different criteria for the user and displaying them within the Frouple app. This additional information increases the probability of coming into contact with matching user profiles.

                <li>For the verification of suspicious profiles via SMS, telephone numbers already used are stored, but cannot be linked to the verified user.</li></ul></p>

                <p><strong>Legal basis</strong><br/>
                Frouple bases the aforementioned data processing on the legitimate interest of Frouple according to Art. 6 I lit. f DSGVO.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5. Will your data be disclosed/ shared?</strong>
                Frouple does not transfer users' personal data to third parties, unless the user has consented to this, the transfer is required by law or permitted by law. Data will not be transferred to third countries outside the EU.</p>
                <p><strong>a. General information on the transfer of personal data User data and other data</strong><br/>
                Frouple discloses personal data to the following third parties for the purpose of executing the contract:
                <ul><li>External service providers and agents. Frouple may engage external companies or individuals to process personal data.</li></ul></p>
                <p><strong>Legal basis</strong><br/>
                Frouple bases the transfer of personal data for the performance of the contract on Art. 28 DSGVO.</p>
                <p><strong>Other disclosure</strong><br/>
                Frouple shares or discloses personal information as follows:
                <ul>
                  <li>In the context of changes in business structure. In connection with mergers,
                acquisitionsinsolvency dissolution proceedings, restructuring, divestitures of some or all of Frouple's assets, financings, acquisitions of some or all of our business, similar transactions or proceedings, or
                    steps taken in contemplation of such activities.</li>
                <li>Within the framework of legal requirements. To comply with legal or regulatory
                  requirements and in response to lawful requests, court orders and legal proceedings.</li>
                <li>In the course of enforcing Frouple's rights, preventing fraud and ensuring safety. To protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Frouple or third parties, including the enforcement of contracts and policies, and in connection with the investigation and prevention of fraud</li>
                <li>Frouple may share aggregated or personally identifiable information with partners or
                others for business or analytics purposes, such as by publishing how many messages are sent through the Frouple app each day.
                  </li></ul></p>
                <p><strong>b. Data recipient</strong><br/>
                We check each of the data recipients in advance for the measures they have taken for data protection and data security and thus ensure the contractual regulations provided by law for the protection of personal data.</p>
                <p><strong>6. What is the procedure for deleting data and creating backups?</strong><br/>
                With the deletion of the user profile or a corresponding notification to Frouple, all collected data of the user will be deleted or anonymised. In addition, the user can at any time delete individual data in the profile himself or request Frouple to do so via a corresponding notification.</p>
                
                <p>Excluded from the deletion is data that has to be kept due to legal retention periods, for the execution of contracts or for the fulfilment of contracts with other users. Therefore, in case of deletion, Frouple will not delete data that you have shared with other users in chats immediately, but only when the owner of the other user profile has deleted it. Until then, the data will be anonymised.</p>
                <p><strong>When do we delete data that a user has shared with other users?</strong><br/>
                Frouple deletes data that is publicly accessible in the user profile, e.g. profile pictures and profile data, immediately according to the above standards.
                Frouple cannot just directly delete data that a user has shared with other users non-publicly via the Frouple app without interfering with the rights of the other users. Therefore, chat content is only deleted once both user profiles have been deleted.</p>
                <p><strong>When does the deletion take place?</strong><br/>
                Deletion from the productive databases takes place immediately. However, deletion from all server tiers, cache memories and backup databases of Frouple can take up to 14 days.</p>
                <p>Frouple reserves the right to check profile files before deleting them and, if necessary, to save them if there are certain facts that give rise to the suspicion that the user profiles are using the Frouple app in violation of the law or in breach of contract. This is to protect the users and the services of Frouple.</p>
                <p>Frouple creates backups to secure the data files, which are overwritten after 14 days and thus permanently deleted. If these contain log files, these will also be deleted. The log files are also deleted in the event of the complete deletion of a user profile.</p>
                <p><strong>7. What data security measures has Frouple taken?</strong><br/>
                To prevent unauthorised access to or disclosure of user information, maintain data integrity, and ensure the appropriate use of data, Frouple has in place appropriate physical, technical, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.<br/>
                For the best possible protection of the user's data, the Frouple app is offered via a secure SSL connection. The data is transmitted in encrypted form both between the servers and the browser and between the servers and the app.</p>
                <p><strong>8. Rights of the user: consent and revocation, information, correction, deletion, Transmission</strong></p>
                <p><strong>a. Consent and revocation</strong><br/>
                The user can revoke consent at any time with effect for the future. This can be done by deleting the user profile, at the specified places in the Frouple app within the user profile or by sending an email to Frouple: <a href="mailto: contact@frouple.com">contact@frouple.com</a></p>
                 
                <p>Pursuant to Article 21 of the GDPR, users have the right to object to data processing by Frouple on grounds relating to their particular situation, insofar as this is based on the legal basis of legitimate interest. Frouple will then stop processing the data, unless Frouple can prove - in accordance with the legal requirements - compelling legitimate grounds for the further processing, which outweigh your rights.</p>
                <p><strong>b. Information, correction, blocking, deletion, transfer</strong><br/>
                In accordance with the applicable laws, the user has a right to free information about the personal data stored about him/her and, if applicable, a right to correction, blocking and/or deletion or transfer of this data.</p>
                <p>For this purpose, the user can contact Frouple by e-mail, for example: <a href="mailto:contact@frouple.com">contact@frouple.com</a></p>
                <p>The user also has the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority about the processing of his/her personal data by Frouple.</p>
                <p><strong>9. Amendment of the privacy policy</strong><br/>
                Frouple will update this Privacy Policy as appropriate. The use of user data is subject to the current version of the privacy policy, which can be found at (https://frouple.com/privacy_policy). In the event of a material change to this statement, the user will be notified by email to the email address associated with the user profile.</p>
                <p><strong>10. Contact for data protection and data protection officers</strong><br>
                In case of questions regarding the collection, processing or use of personal data, for information, correction, blocking or deletion of data as well as revocation of given consents, the user should delete his user profile or change it at the indicated places in the Frouple app within the user profile or contact Frouple by email at <a href="contact@frouple.com">contact@frouple.com</a>

                Zur Bereitstellung der angebotenen Dienste der Frouple-App benötigt Frouple verschiedene Zugriffsmöglichkeiten und Informationen.
                Je nach Betriebssystem wird bereits beim Installationsvorgang eine Einwilligung für den Zugriff auf einzelne Funktionen und Informationen abgefragt. Die Zugriffsberechtigungen umfassen das Versenden von E-Mails, Benachrichtigungen sowie die Nutzung mobiler Daten.
                Unter den Einstellungen des Endgeräts und in der Frouple-App können diese Berechtigungen manuell entzogen werden. Je nach Version der Frouple-App werden vor oder nach der Installation Berechtigungen abgefragt.</p>
                <p><strong> Wie werden meine Daten nach Erstellen eines Nutzerprofils und bei der Nutzung der Frouple-App erhoben, verarbeitet und genutzt?</strong><br/>
                Frouple verwendet die personenbezogenen Daten, die der Nutzer mitteilt oder die bei der Nutzung der Frouple-App nach Erstellen eines Nutzerprofils anfallen, ohne gesonderte Einwilligung ausschließlich zur Durchführung des Nutzungsverhältnisses. Für eine Nutzung der Frouple-App ist es notwendig, dass sich der Nutzer ein Nutzerprofil erstellt. Dazu muss der Nutzer weitere personenbezogene Daten angeben, die Frouple zur Erbringung der jeweiligen Leistung nutzt.<p>

                <p><b>4. Wie werden meine Daten von Frouple zu Werbezwecken genutzt?</b><br/>
                Frouple nutzt Deine vollständigen Daten nur für den Betrieb der Frouple-App und zur Optimierung unseres Produkts. Wir geben niemals Deine sensiblen Daten (z. B. Name, Profilbild oder E-Mail-Adresse) an Dritte für Werbezwecke weiter.</p>
                <p>Frouple nutzt Daten zu Werbezwecken zur Eigenwerbung.<br/>
                Frouple zeigt den Nutzern in der Frouple-App Eigenwerbung an und informiert diese auch per E-Mail, z. B. über Angebote. Eine Einwilligung hierfür wird eingeholt. Um passende Angebote anzeigen zu können, verwendet Frouple Informationen, die Frouple vom Nutzer mitgeteilt werden und Informationen, die Frouple aufgrund der Nutzung der Frouple-App automatisch erhält.<br/>
                Der Nutzer kann der Nutzung zu Werbezwecken jederzeit widersprechen, indem er personalisierte Werbung in seinen Geräteeinstellungen deaktiviert.
                Die Datenweitergabe erfolgt ausschließlich wie unter 5. dargestellt.</p>

                  <p><b>a. Allgemeine Hinweise zur Weitergabe von personenbezogenen Daten</b></p>
                  <p><b>Nutzerdaten und sonstige Daten</b><br/>
                Frouple gibt personenbezogene Daten zur Vertragsdurchführung an folgende Dritte weiter:
                <ul><li>Externe Serviceanbieter und Vertreter. Frouple kann externe Unternehmen oder
                  Personen mit der Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten beauftragen.</li></ul></p>
                <p><b>Rechtsgrundlage</b><br/>
                Frouple stützt die Weitergabe personenbezogener Daten zur Vertragsdurchführung auf Art. 28 DSGVO.</p>
                  <p><b>Sonstige Weitergabe</b><br/>
                Frouple gibt personenbezogene Daten wie folgt weiter bzw. legt sie offen:
                <ul><li>Im Rahmen von Änderungen der Geschäftsstruktur. Im Zusammenhang mit Fusionen, Übernahmen, Insolvenzverfahren, Auflösungsverfahren, Restrukturierungsmaßnahmen, Veräußerungen eines Teils oder aller Vermögensgegenstände von Frouple, Finanzierungen, Übernahmen eines Teils oder unseres gesamten Geschäfts, ähnlichen Transaktionen oder Verfahren oder Schritten
                    in Erwägung derartiger Aktivitäten.</li>
                <li>Im Rahmen der gesetzlichen Vorschriften. Zur Einhaltung gesetzlicher Bestimmungen
                oder behördlicher Auflagen und in Reaktion auf rechtmäßige Anfragen,
                    Gerichtsbeschlüsse und Rechtsverfahren.</li>
                <li>Im Rahmen der Durchsetzung der Rechte von Frouple, zur Verhinderung von Betrug
                und zur Gewährleistung der Sicherheit. Zum Schutz und zur Verteidigung der Rechte, des Eigentums bzw. der Sicherheit von Frouple oder Dritten, einschließlich der Durchsetzung von Verträgen und Richtlinien, sowie im Zusammenhang mit der Untersuchung und Verhinderung von Betrug.</li>
                <li>Frouple darf aggregierte oder um personenbezogene Merkmale bereinigte Daten an Partner oder andere für geschäftliche oder Analysezwecke weitergeben, indem Frouple z. B. veröffentlicht, wie viele Nachrichten über die Frouple-App täglich versendet werden.</li></ul></p>
                <p><b>b. Datenempfänger</b><br/>
                Wir prüfen jeden der Datenempfänger vorher auf die von ihm zum Datenschutz und zur Datensicherheit getroffenen Maßnahmen und stellen so die gesetzlich vorgesehenen vertraglichen Regelungen zum Schutz der personenbezogenen Daten sicher.</p>
                <p><b>6. Wie läuft die Datenlöschung und das Erstellen von Backups ab?</b><br/>
                Mit der Löschung des Nutzerprofils oder einer entsprechenden Benachrichtigung an Frouple, werden alle erhobenen Daten des Nutzers gelöscht oder anonymisiert. Zudem kann der Nutzer zu jeder Zeit die Löschung von einzelnen Daten im Profil selbst vornehmen oder bei Frouple über eine entsprechende Benachrichtigung beantragen.</p>
                
                <p>Von der Löschung ausgenommen bleiben Daten, die aufgrund gesetzlicher Aufbewahrungsfristen, zur Vertragsabwicklung oder zur Vertragserfüllung mit anderen Nutzern vorgehalten werden müssen. Frouple löscht daher im Falle einer Löschung insbesondere Daten, die Du mit anderen Nutzern in Chats geteilt hast nicht sofort, sondern erst, wenn der Inhaber des anderen Nutzerprofils dieses auch gelöscht hat. Bis dahin werden die Daten anonymisiert.</p>
                <b>Wann löschen wir Daten, die ein Nutzer mit anderen Nutzern geteilt hat?</b><br/>
                Frouple löscht Daten, die öffentlich im Nutzerprofil zugänglich sind, z. B. Profilbilder und Profildaten, unverzüglich nach den obigen Maßstäben.
                Frouple kann Daten, die ein Nutzer über die Frouple-App mit anderen Nutzern nicht öffentlich geteilt hat, nicht einfach direkt löschen, ohne dabei in die Rechte der anderen Nutzer einzugreifen. Daher werden Chat-Inhalte erst gelöscht, wenn beide Nutzerprofile gelöscht wurden.</p>
                <p><b>Wann erfolgt die Löschung?</b><br/>
                Eine Löschung aus den Produktiv-Datenbanken erfolgt unverzüglich. Die Löschung aus allen Serverschichten, Cache-Speichern und Sicherungsdatenbanken von Frouple kann jedoch bis zu 14 Tage in Anspruch nehmen.<p>
                <p>Frouple behält es sich vor, Profil-Dateien vor einer Löschung zu überprüfen und gegebenenfalls zu sichern, wenn bei den Nutzerprofilen aufgrund bestimmter Tatsachen der Verdacht besteht, dass diese die Frouple-App gesetzeswidrig oder vertragswidrig nutzen. Dies dient dem Schutz der Nutzer und der Services von Frouple.</p>
                <p>Frouple erstellt zur Sicherung der Datenbestände Backups, die jeweils nach 14 Tagen überschrieben und damit endgültig gelöscht werden. Soweit diese Protokolldateien enthalten, werden auch diese gelöscht. Auch im Fall der vollständigen Löschung eines Nutzerprofils werden die Protokolldateien gelöscht.</p>
                <p><b>7. Welche Maßnahmen zur Datensicherheit hat Frouple getroffen?</b><br/>
                Um unbefugten Zugriff auf Nutzerdaten oder deren Preisgabe zu verhindern, um die Integrität der Daten zu bewahren und die angemessene Verwendung der Daten zu gewährleisten, setzt Frouple geeignete physische, technische und administrative Verfahren zum Schutz der von Frouple erhobenen Informationen ein.<br/>
                Für einen bestmöglichen Schutz der Daten des Nutzers erfolgt das Angebot der Frouple-App über eine gesicherte SSL-Verbindung. Die Daten werden sowohl zwischen den Servern und dem Browser als auch zwischen den Servern und der App verschlüsselt übertragen.</p>
                <p><b>8. Rechte des Nutzers: Einwilligung und Widerruf, Auskunft, Berichtigung, Löschung, Übertragung</b></p>
                <p><b>a. Einwilligung und Widerruf</b><br/>
                Eine Einwilligung kann der Nutzer jederzeit mit Wirkung für die Zukunft widerrufen. Dies kann durch Löschung des Nutzerprofils, an den angegebenen Stellen in der Frouple-App innerhalb des Nutzerprofils oder per E-Mail an Frouple erfolgen:
                  E-Mail: <a href="mailto:contact@frouple.com">contact@frouple.com</a></p>
                 
                <p>Nutzer haben nach Art. 21 DSGVO das Recht, aus Gründen, die sich aus ihrer besonderen Situation ergeben, der Datenverarbeitung durch Frouple zu widersprechen, soweit diese auf der Rechtsgrundlage berechtigtes Interesse beruht. Frouple wird dann die Verarbeitung der Daten einstellen, es sei denn, Frouple kann – gemäß den gesetzlichen Vorgaben – zwingende schutzwürdige Gründe für die Weiterverarbeitung nachweisen, welche Deine Rechte überwiegen.</p>
                <p><b>b. Auskunft, Berichtigung, Sperrung, Löschung, Übertragung</b><br/>
                Der Nutzer hat nach den geltenden Gesetzen einen Anspruch auf unentgeltliche Auskunft über die von ihm gespeicherten personenbezogenen Daten sowie gegebenenfalls ein Recht auf Berichtigung, Sperrung und/oder Löschung bzw. Übertragung dieser Daten.</p>
                <p>Der Nutzer kann sich dazu z. B. per E-Mail an Frouple wenden: E-Mail: <a href="mailto:contact@frouple.com">contact@frouple.com</a>
                <p>Der Nutzer hat zudem das Recht, sich bei einer Datenschutz-Aufsichtsbehörde über die Verarbeitung seiner personenbezogenen Daten durch Frouple zu beschweren.</p>
                <p><b>9. Änderung der Datenschutzerklärung</b><br/>
                Frouple wird diese Datenschutzerklärung gegebenenfalls aktualisieren. Die Verwendung der Nutzer-Daten unterliegt der jeweils aktuellen Version der Datenschutzerklärung, die unter (<a href="https://frouple.com/privacy_policy">https://frouple.com/privacy_policy</a>) abgerufen werden kann. Im Falle einer wesentlichen Änderung dieser Erklärung wird der Nutzer per E-Mail an die mit dem Nutzerprofil verknüpfte E-Mail-Adresse benachrichtigt.</p>
                <p><b>10. Ansprechpartner für Datenschutz und Datenschutzbeauftragte</b><br/>
                Bei Fragen zur Erhebung, Verarbeitung oder Nutzung von personenbezogenen Daten, bei Auskünften, Berichtigungen, Sperrung oder Löschung von Daten sowie Widerruf erteilter Einwilligungen soll der Nutzer sein Nutzerprofil löschen oder an den angegebenen Stellen in der Frouple-App innerhalb des Nutzerprofils ändern oder sich per E-Mail an Frouple wenden.</p>
